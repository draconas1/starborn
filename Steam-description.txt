[h1]Starborn[/h1]
Have you ever wanted to abandon planets completely and live among the stars?  Like the Quarion of Mass Effect live safe in your artificial habitat, but unable to set foot on your home world again?

Starborn does this, it introduces a new game start civic: Starborn.

Selecting this civic turns your starting planet into an orbital city orbiting the desolate remains of your homeworld.  When your world was devastated in nuclear war, only the inhabitants of the city survived.
You can build habitats from game start, starting small and enlarging as you get the resources, and your habitats will gain special districts based on what they are in orbit of and what orbital deposit it has.

But there is a catch, your species has spent so long living in habitats that planetary biospheres are now toxic and uninhabitable for you.


[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Start in unique habitat: the orbital city, in orbit around a tomb world, with unique districts that kept your civilisation alive when their world burned
[*] Enlarge your orbital city as you discover relevant techs and relevant ascension perks  
[*] Start with hydroponics farming technology - you've survived in space, you understand hydroponics!
[*] Build small habitats from game start and expand them as your empire grows
[*] Habitats gain unique districts or buildings based on the type of object and deposits they are built around
[*] Build around habitable planet: biosphere farming
[*] Asteroid: +25% mineral extraction
[*] Star: +25% energy production
[*] Build Habitats around almost all stellar bodies
[*] Planetary decisions to add more districts to habitats based on certain technologies (Space Station ones)
[*] Use edicts to adjust the habitat build size and cost to reduce micromanagement
[*] Optional OP starting system if you want it
[/list]
[i]There are lots of other effects for different types of planets and the different orbital deposits, you'll need to discover them in play[/i]
 
[h1]Requirements[/h1]
Utopia DLC

[h1]Gameplay Notes[/h1]
Remember that habitats cost alloys in maintenance!  Starborn builds will have a constant need for more alloy production.

I do not adjust the Voidborn Ascension Perk, so you will have the ability to build normal habitats when you buy it.  Those are completely vanilla and I suggest avoiding them, I've not taken them out to try to limit compatibility problems.

It does require a fair quantity of micromanagement, due to the small nature of the habitats, I have done my best to balance difficulty and ease, suggestions welcome.
You can try to "cheat" by enacting the fully enlarge habitat decisions and also the construct more habitat decision at once, because there is not an easy way to immediately deactivate one decision based on another being selected (and in progress).  Go on, try it, I dare you.  

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod makes changes to:
[list]
[*] City Districts
[*] Most Habitat Districts
[*] habitable_structure scripted trigger
[/list]
So will have compatibility problems with any other mod that changes these.  The most obvious sign is when you go to the Orbital City you will see Housing, Mining, Generating and Farming districts instead of Habitat Housing, Nature Preserve, Tombworld Scavenger and Solar Panel ones.  

It is compatible with 2.3 !!District Overhaul, there is no need for a patch.
It is compatible with Dyson Swarm, and you can use the 2 mods together for the ultimate "no planets" experience.  Though it is incompatible with the Dyson Swarm starting civic and not takeable if you have selected Dyson Swarm start.

[h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]
[i]Have the option to build a mining hab but nothing happens when you press it? or right click on a star with energy or asteroid with mineral it does not give an option to build?[/i]
The most likely reason is that your target is not a valid build target for some reason, but if no megastructure is a valid build target, there is a bug in 2.2.x that the game does not show any of the build megastructures dialogues that tell you exactly why you can't build them.  This is very annoying and forces you to guess, I have reported a bug but we have to wait until PDX fixes it.  They haven't yet and its now 2.3.1, I reported it in 2.2.3

Since PDX are not fixing it in a hurry, I have created another mod that creates a dummy megastructure to force the dialog to appear [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1765448025]Can't Build Megastructure Reason[/url]

[h1]Credit and Thanks[/h1]
The Orbital City ring is from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1121692237]Gigastructures[/url]  and the nature preserve and scavenger districts were inspired by similar ones from their mod.
The building art for Zro Temple, Dark Matter Generator and Living Metal Refinery come from CGM Planets.

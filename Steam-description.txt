[h1]Starborn: the Improved Voidtouched Habitat Start (3.2)[/h1]
The Mod that did Voidtouched before PDX did.

Start on a unique habitat - the Orbital City, built above the ruins of your original homeworld.  Build habitats almost anywhere that gain special bonuses and modifiers based on the planet and deposits they are around.  Your species adapted to life on habitats now cannot live on planets anymore, not that you care, who needs to search for habitatable planets when all of the void is habitable to you?  

Build habitats modulally - as you empire starts and resources are a premium you can start smaller and expand when you can, gaining additional decisions to take habitats to larger than anything the normal races can produce.  

Create huge habitats that span solar systems - rather than manage 10 small habitats in 1 system, manage a single habitat that spreads across the available planets in the system.

[h1]Origin Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Start in unique habitat: the orbital city, in orbit around a tomb world, with unique districts that kept your civilisation alive when their world burned
[*] Build habitats around almost any stellar body.
[*] Your adaption to space means your habitats may get additional deposits, buildings or modifiers based on the body type and deposits such as asteroids - great for mining, molten planets - great for alloys, black holes: whole lot of physics research.
[*] Edict to change the size habitats are built at to reduce late game micromanagement
[*] Negative Starborn trait can be managed via all 3 ascension perks, and "solved" with Genetic Mastery
[/list]
[i]There are lots of other effects for different types of planets and the different orbital deposits, you'll need to discover them in play or read the spoiler post in discussion[/i]

[h1]All players Features[/h1]
(these are avilable to all players regardless of taking the origin)
[list]
[*] Satellite Habitat Complex megastructure lets you expand your habitats to encompass the entire system without having to manage all the individual planets.  Built it around a planet and one of your existing habitats gets a size boost and access to that planets resources.
[*] Ability to build vanilla size 6 and size 8 habitats directly once you have the tech (will show as additional megastructures).
[/list]

Federations DLC is not required as this is my own work that predates VoidTouched, it has been made voidtouched compatible for ease of playstyles. 

[h1]Gameplay Notes[/h1]
Remember that habitats cost alloys in maintenance!  You get a small refund on size 4 habitats.  It is cheaper to build habitats at max size using the edict menu than it is to build them at small size then scale up with the decision, that is by design.

I do not adjust normal habitats so you will have the ability to build normal habitats, you probably don't want to build them and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2056951736]this addon mod[/url] will disable them for starborn empires.

By using the Satellite Complex megastructure it is entirely possible to have a habitat that has too many district types to show on the default UI (with the right system you can easily have mining, energy, trade and research districts).  I strongly recommend a UI mod that allows for more districts, I use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1623423360]UI Overhaul Dynamic[/url]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod makes changes to:
[list]
[*] Vanilla "expand habitat" decisions
[*] Adjusts the final Worm in Waiting event to not do stupid things to the Oribtal City.

[h1]Credit and Thanks[/h1]
The nature preserve and scavenger districts were inspired by similar ones from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1121692237]Gigastructures[/url].
The building art for come from CGM Planets.
ViolentBeetle on Stellaris Modding Den discord gave me a great deal of help, without which I never would have been able to do the planet and habitat linking

[h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]
The starborn edicts, habitats and bonuses only apply if you take the Starborn Origin.  If you take another origin they will be locked to you.

The Satellite habitat complex is available to everyone and unlocks with Tier 3 habitat tech.  

Additionally non-starborn players will see 2 new habitat megastrucutre options when they unlock the right tech: advanced habitats and advanced habitat worlds.  These are vanilla habitats built directly at size 6 and 8 respectively (and cost the same as if you had upgraded via decisions)

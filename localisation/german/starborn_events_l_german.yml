 START_SCREEN_STARBORN_6:0 "Life for our forefathers was hard. The city had not been designed to be the new cradle of life and drastic changes were needed quickly, several times we were nearly snuffed out by accidents, civil unrest and dispair.

Our people have spent so long living in our artifical city with its recycled air and carefully controlled environment that our immune systems have weakened and our bodies changed such that planetary environments are hostile to us, we can no longer live on natures cradles.\n\n   We must make our own homes among the stars."
